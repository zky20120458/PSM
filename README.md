PSM (propensity match)
=========================

Based on the python environment, it can be used to complete propensity matching experiments, including data input, model modeling, model calculation, and result display.

Feature
=========================
- Many model-related common parameters have been encapsulated for streamlined use.
- Suitable for beginners or those who want to do psm research based on python.
- Some code comments are in Chinese.
- Provides a demonstration sample, readers can use the sample to speed up the understanding of the program content.

Background
=========================
Most of the psm programs on the Internet are written based on R language or other languages, which is a headache for users who use python for experimental research, so this code is developed for the convenience of experimenters and to make experimental research work easier.
